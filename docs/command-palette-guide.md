# Command Palette Quick Guide

## What is it?

The Command Palette is a fast, keyboard-driven way to navigate your CMMS application. Think of it as a universal search and action center.

## How to Open

**Three ways:**

1. **Keyboard**: Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux)
2. **Mouse**: Click the "Quick search..." button in the top bar (desktop only)
3. **Automatic**: Opens when you press the keyboard shortcut from anywhere

## What Can You Do?

### Navigate to Pages

Type any of these to jump directly:
- `dashboard` - Go to Dashboard
- `work` - Go to Work Orders
- `assets` - Go to Assets
- `customers` - Go to Customers
- `technicians` - Go to Technicians
- `inventory` - Go to Inventory
- `locations` - Go to Service Centers
- `scheduling` - Go to Scheduling
- `reports` - Go to Reports
- `settings` - Go to Settings

### Quick Actions

- **Create Work Order** - Start a new work order
- **Add Asset** - Register a new vehicle
- **Add Customer** - Create a customer record

### Recent Items

The palette automatically shows:
- **Last 5 work orders** you viewed
- **Last 5 assets** you accessed

Just start typing the work order number or license plate to find them quickly.

## Tips & Tricks

### Fuzzy Search
You don't need to type the exact name. The search is smart:
- Type `wo` to find "Work Orders"
- Type `tech` to find "Technicians"
- Type `inv` to find "Inventory"

### Keyboard Navigation
- `↑` `↓` - Move between items
- `Enter` - Select highlighted item
- `Esc` - Close the palette

### Speed Workflow
1. Press `Cmd+K`
2. Type first few letters
3. Press `Enter`
4. You're there!

Example: `Cmd+K` → `wo` → `Enter` = Work Orders page in 2 seconds

## Common Workflows

### Find a Work Order
1. `Cmd+K`
2. Scroll to "Recent Work Orders" section
3. Click the work order you need

### Create Something New
1. `Cmd+K`
2. Type "create" or "add"
3. Select the action you want

### Jump Between Sections

2. Type the section name
3. Press `Enter`

## Power User Tips

- **Keep your hands on the keyboard** - The palette is designed for keyboard-only use
- **Use it often** - The more you use it, the faster you'll navigate
- **Recent items are your friend** - They update automatically based on what you view
- **Don't close it to search again** - Just start typing a new search

## Troubleshooting

**Keyboard shortcut not working?**
- Make sure you're not in a text input field
- Try clicking outside any input first, then press `Cmd+K`

**Not seeing recent items?**
- Recent items only show after you've viewed work orders or assets
- They update in real-time as you navigate

**Search not finding what I need?**
- Try typing just the first few letters
- Check the different sections (Navigation, Quick Actions, Recent Items)
- Remember: it searches command names, not data

## What's Next?

Future enhancements planned:
- Search within work orders and assets
- Custom keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Search history
- Technician quick actions
- Customer search
